	castTime - in seconds

	dot stacks
	max targets
	damage reduction for multiple targets

	*** use the meta to store a means of executing the spell components? maybe with their support for functions / properties / etc
	will we need to use a flag component to let us know which entities need this special processing? this would allow us to queue them
	up with the other spells e.g. damage and heals
	
	*** ISpellContainer - allows a component to contain a list of spells that can be cast when interacting with them. Players and NPCs
	would need spells for things like trading, inspecting, ... or maybe that should just be intrinsic - will need to flesh that
	out a little better.
